<h2><b>Commom symtoms</b></h2>
<p>According to information gathered from researchers in China, the most comon symptoms among people who had COVID-19 include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Fever 83%-99%</li>

 <li>Shortness of breath 31%-40%</li>

<p>If you have any of these symptoms, isolate yourself. This means staying away from other people as much as possible, even members of your family. Stay in a specific “sick room,” and use a separate bathroom if you can. If you have symptoms and are at high risk of complications because of your age or other health conditions, call your doctor in addition to isolating yourself.</p>
